        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>"Itchlist: a better wishlist" is a platform that aims to ease the "what can we gift?" problem. Just add your "itches" to your list an share it with your dears/friends</p>

        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>You create a list of items that you would like to have and share it with anyone you want (with the unique url generated via the SHARE funzionality). Or your friends can search your list from the searchbar</p>

        <h2>Why only items on Amazon?</h2>
        <p>Find an item on someone's list that is in a non reliable store can make it difficult to buy and this is not what we want. Limiting the items to be on a reliable and recognized store is a way to ease the process of making a gift</p>

        <h2>Why login with Facebook?</h2>
        <p>It should be easy for you to find your friends and you already know the nickname and profile picture of your friends on Facebbok so you can be sure to find them. If anyone could login and choose a fancy name it would be diffucult to find your friends and ensure their identity</p>

        <h2>Sustainability</h2>
        <p>The service is completely free with no ads. We get kickbacks when someone buy an item through links on this site from the Amazon affiliate program</p>
