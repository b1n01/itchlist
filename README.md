# Itchlist: a better whishlist 

ðŸ’¢ [https://itchlist.b1n01.com](Itchlist) is a platform that lets user build and share whishlists build around their social network. 

## Up and running

Uses using [laravel homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/homestead) for local development

## Note

Migration should be run from inside the vagrant machines in order to success

## Keypoints

A platform that allows you to create whislists, the classic whishlists, birthdays, weddings, etc .... However, there are key constraints: it is necessary to access the platform with a social account, initially only facebook, and the links must point to articles in online stores that offer affiliate services. The first constraint allows us to facilitate the search on the platform: you can search the wishlists of all your friends on social networks and send them an invitation if they are not present on the platform. The second allows us to give those who have to buy the article a concrete tool for the purchase, not just an indication of the product that must then be searched independently, it also allows us to guard against affiliate links and be able to keep the platform free. and without advertising.
